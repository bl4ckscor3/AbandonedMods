# Abandoned Mods
These mods date back to 2013/2014 when I had just recently started modifying Minecraft. These mods will most likely not get updated or remade.

"DecoOres" was supposed to be a mod with which you can have decorative items regarding ores and it would include mod's ores as well. It currently only has normal ore blocks as decoration.

"WoodConverter new" is the old rewritten WoodConverter from before Geforce was an awesome human and wrote the current [WoodConverter GUI](https://trello.com/b/PJU5lI6Q/wood-converter-gui) for me.
It has a few converting blocks and an ore which was needed to run these converter blocks, similar to a vanilla furnace.

"Scarecrow" was a mod with, you guessed it, scarecrows. They would serve as a protector of your fields or house etc. as they didn't allow mobs to come near to them.
I planned several tiers of scarecrows, which have different abilities and effects on the mobs and a higher range where mobs couldn't spawn/come close to.
